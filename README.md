# Panic Reader
Super Basic Speed Reader Built with Svelte &amp; Tailwind

## Why?
Just a bit of fun as the old rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) concept is kinda cool to explore a bit. It's nothing fancy, I'm sure there's some jankyness in the code, but overall it's pretty simple. If you're messing with Svelte or Tailwind for the first time you might find this useful to mess around with for a bit.

## Notes
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) as Framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for Styling
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) as component library

## Usage
1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Gingerbreadfork/panic-reader/`
2. Change to the new directory with `cd panic-reader`
3. Install the dependencies with `npm i`
4. Test with `npm run dev` or build it for deployment with `npm run build`
